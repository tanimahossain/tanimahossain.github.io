Competitive programming taught me to think critically, approach problems creatively, and optimize solutions. This foundation, coupled with 2+ years of full-stack engineering experience in JavaScript (TypeScript), Node.js (Express.js), Sanity (headless CMS), Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL/Knex, allows me to translate complex challenges into elegant and scalable real-world applications. I'm a collaborative learner, enthusiastic about pushing boundaries and exceeding expectations while being a driven team player eager to contribute my skillset and learning agility to your vision
